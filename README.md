- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ChronisD2005 
- I am currently a student in my hometown Thessaloniki, Greece attending a university in computer science and engineering.
- Since I just started my journey I really do not have many of the programming skills to make an actual project but that does not mean I'm not ready.
- I am more than willing to start learning and participating in projects and exercises. I'm personally interested in game coding and development but I am open to any ideas.
- I am currently learning C in my university and I am also new to this platform.
- If you need to talk to me, you can find me using my email: polychronis.doumpas@gmail.com
- Thank you for reading this! I hope you are having a nice day (If you do not tell me).
